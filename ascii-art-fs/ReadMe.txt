Hello Auditer!
This project is done by future students of Reboot01.
You could see the team members by using the project.
run the program as it is required.
go run main.go "{add the text that you would like to print}" "{type of font}"
if you didn't select any type of font it will print with the standard font.
You could find our usernames (members of the team) by commanding "Ascii Art FS Team"
Have fun and enjoy listening to our project.
Good luck!
